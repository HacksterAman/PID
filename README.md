# Angle Correction with PID Control

This Python script demonstrates angle correction using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control in a tkinter GUI environment. PID control is a widely used technique in control systems for achieving desired outputs in various applications, including robotics, industrial automation, and process control.

## PID Control

PID control is a feedback control loop mechanism that continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable. The controller then applies corrections to the system based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms to minimize this error and achieve the desired output.

The PID control equation is given by:

```
correction = Kp * error + Ki * âˆ«(error) dt + Kd * d(error)/dt
```

- **Kp (Proportional Gain)**: Adjusts the output in proportion to the current error. It determines the responsiveness of the controller to the current error.

- **Ki (Integral Gain)**: Adjusts the output based on the accumulation of past errors over time. It helps in eliminating steady-state errors.

- **Kd (Derivative Gain)**: Adjusts the output based on the rate of change of the error. It helps in damping oscillations and improving stability.

## Code Description

The provided Python script `angle_correction_pid.py` implements angle correction using PID control in a tkinter GUI. Here's how it works:

1. The user sets the current angle, desired angle, PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd), and error threshold using sliders in the GUI.

2. Upon clicking the "Start Correction" button, the script calculates the necessary corrections to drive the current angle towards the desired angle using PID control.

3. The script iterates through the PID control loop, applying corrections to the current angle until the error falls below the specified threshold or a maximum iteration limit is reached.

4. The final angle after correction is displayed, along with a detailed log of the correction process in a separate results window.

## Use Cases

- **Robotics**: PID control is commonly used in robotics for tasks such as controlling motor position, stabilizing robotic arms, and maintaining balance in mobile robots.

- **Aerospace**: PID control is used in aircraft autopilot systems for maintaining heading, altitude, and airspeed.

- **Industrial Automation**: PID control is applied in industrial processes such as temperature control, pressure regulation, and flow control.

- **Renewable Energy**: PID control is utilized in renewable energy systems like solar trackers and wind turbine control systems to optimize energy generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually included in Python standard library)
